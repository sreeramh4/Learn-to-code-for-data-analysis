More efficient calculations can be performed on pandas dataframes using methods. A method is a function that can only be called in a certain context. In this course, the context will mostly be a dataframe or a column. A method call looks like a function call, but adds the context in which to call the method: context.methodName(argument1, argument2, ...). In other words, a dataframe method can only be called on dataframes, a column method only on columns. **Because methods are functions, a method call returns a value and is therefore an expression.**"

    "This week you learned how to use Jupyter notebooks to write and execute simple programs with Python and the pandas module. You have seen how to load a table from an Excel file, select a column, and compute some simple statistics (like the total, minimum and median) about it. You have also learned how to create a new column with values calculated from other columns. And finally you have seen how to sort a table by one of its columns.\n",

    "Good programmers don’t just write code, they write readable code, and I’ve insisted on the use of clear variable names and the use of comments. Last but not least, you have received some guidance on how to write up a data analysis and how to share it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next week you will learn further ways to manipulate dataframes, in particular to clean data. You will also produce your first data chart, showing variations of values over time."
